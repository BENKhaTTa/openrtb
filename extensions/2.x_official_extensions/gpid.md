### Global Placement Id(gpid)

**Sponsor**: The Trade Desk

**Goal**:
The Global Placement ID (GPID) was an initiative in the Fall of 2021 led by the TradeDesk to solve the problem of inventory identification in an industry-wide way. It aims to give buyers a way to identify a given ad slot on a page across SSPs and header bidding integrations. 


### Object: GPID <a name="object_gpid"></a>


<strong>General Guidelines</strong>
* Focus on the placement that is being sold.
* Avoid including any information that that's already in another part of the bid request. For example, there is no need to include domain, ad format, seller, if it's a mobile placement, and so on.
- Provide a descriptive, named placement rather than a numerical or alphanumerical one.
- Use delimiters, preferably forward slashes (/).
- Apply consistent formatting.
